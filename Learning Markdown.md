## Learning to Write in Markdown is **FUN**

This line is the first line of a paragraph.   
This line is the second, distinct line of the paragraph (separated by two spaces at the end of the first line) 

Two spaces makes a new paragraph that is distinct from the first. StackEditor doesn't require the double space after the period to make a single space break between paragraphs. Other Markdown Editors do, though. 

I think this is going to be *challenging* but also **really** fun, _**despite** how confusing_ it is (nailed it).

This is how politics _works_ 

And now we get to really _use_ the _medium_ of Digital History by creating links between content and forms, like on [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/ "Programming Historian main page")
Or a less messy way of linking: [Programming Historian][1]

Don't I look impressive? Kind of like this:

But really I am much more like this:

Remember, as a great scientist once said, the only difference between just blowing stuff up and real science is writing it down.
